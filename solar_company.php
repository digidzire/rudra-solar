                    <p>Solar energy is the conversion of sunlight into electricity which is not only renewable in nature but also helps in reducing your carbon footprint. Every living being needs sunlight to survive. Until now we havenâ€™t fully utilized what the sun has to offer, but now the scenario is changing. Solar energy is now becoming the preferred form of energy. India is blessed with abundant solar energy and around 300 sunny days in a year which has an insolation of 4-7kwh per square meter a day.</p>
                    <p>Servotech Power Systems LTD. is the leading solar EPC Company in India, with over 18 years of experience in the solar industry. We provide complete solar solutions for solar power projects, including engineering, procurement, construction, and commissioning.</p>

                            <p class="lh-lg">An on-grid/grid-tied solar system is one that is connected to the power grid, meaning any surplus or deficit power can be fed into the grid via net metering. A perfect fit for homes, residential users prefer on-grid solar systems since they allow them to receive credit for the surplus power their system generates while also saving money on their electricity bills. Whether you use the solar system or the grid, you will always have power.</p>

                            <p class="lh-lg">A hybrid solar energy system is one that combines On-Grid and Off-Grid solar energy technologies. It can be described simply as a grid-connected solar power system with a battery backup. This solution gives you the option of storing the power generated by your solar system throughout the day in batteries rather than feeding it back into the power grid. Instead of purchasing electricity from the government grid at a higher price, the very same electricity can be used for the post-sunset hours.</p>
